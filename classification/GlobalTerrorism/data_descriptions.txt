DATABASE VARIABLES
I. GTD ID and Date
GTD ID
(eventid)
Numeric Variable
Incidents from the GTD follow a 12-digit Event ID system.
• First 8 numbers – date recorded “yyyymmdd”.
• Last 4 numbers – sequential case number for the given day (0001, 0002 etc). This
is “0001” unless there is more than one case occurring on the same date.
For example, an incident in the GTD occurring on 25 July 1993 would be numbered as
“199307250001”. An additional GTD case recorded for the same day would be
“199307250002”. The next GTD case recorded for that day would be “199307250003”,
etc.
In rare cases, corrections to the date of a GTD attack are made. In order to maintain
stable Event ID numbers, date changes are not reflected in the Event ID.
(iyear)
Numeric Variable
This field contains the year in which the incident occurred. In the case of incident(s)
occurring over an extended period, the field will record the year when the incident was
initiated.
(imonth)
Numeric Variable
This field contains the number of the month in which the incident occurred. In the case
of incident(s) occurring over an extended period, the field will record the month when
the incident was initiated.
When the exact month of the incident is unknown, this will be recorded as “0”.
(iday)
Numeric Variable
Year
Month
Day
13
GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE CODEBOOK ©UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND JUNE 2017
This field contains the numeric day of the month on which the incident occurred. In the
case of incident(s) occurring over an extended period, the field will record the day when
the incident was initiated.
When the exact day of the incident is unknown, the field is recorded as “0”.
(approxdate)
Text Variable
Whenever the exact date of the incident is not known or remains unclear, this field is
used to record the approximate date of the incident.
 If the day of the incident is not known, then the value for “Day” is “0”. For
example, if an incident occurred in June 1978 and the exact day is not known,
then the value for the “Day” field is “0” and the value for the “Approximate
Date” field is “June 1978”.
 If the month is not known, then the value for the “Month” field is “0”. For
example, if an incident occurred in the first half of 1978, and the values for the
day and the month are not known, then the value for the “Day” and “Month”
fields will both be “0” and the value for the “Approximate Date” field is “first half
of 1978.”
(extended)
Categorical Variable
1 = "Yes" The duration of an incident extended more than 24 hours.
0 = "No" The duration of an incident extended less than 24 hours.
(resolution)
Numeric Date Variable
This field only applies if “Extended Incident?” is “Yes” and records the date in which the
incident was resolved (hostages released by perpetrators; hostages killed; successful
rescue, etc.)
II. Incident Information
(summary)
Approximate Date
Extended Incident?
Date of Extended Incident Resolution
Incident Summary
14
GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE CODEBOOK ©UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND JUNE 2017
Text Variable
A brief narrative summary of the incident, noting the “when, where, who, what, how,
and why.”
Note: This field is presently only systematically available with incidents occurring after
1997.
(crit1, crit2, crit3)
Categorical Variables
These variables record which of the inclusion criteria (in addition to the necessary
criteria) are met. This allows users to filter out those incidents whose inclusion was
based on a criterion which they believe does not constitute terrorism proper. Note that
for each of the criteria variables a case is coded as “1” if source information indicates
that the criterion is met and “0” if source information indicates that the criterion is not
met or that there is no indication that it is met.
Criterion 1: POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, RELIGIOUS, OR SOCIAL GOAL (CRIT1)
The violent act must be aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious, or
social goal. This criterion is not satisfied in those cases where the perpetrator(s)
acted out of a pure profit motive or from an idiosyncratic personal motive
unconnected with broader societal change.
1 = "Yes" The incident meets Criterion 1.
0 = "No" The incident does not meet Criterion 1 or there is no indication
that the incident meets Criterion 1.
Criterion 2: INTENTION TO COERCE, INTIMIDATE OR PUBLICIZE TO LARGER
AUDIENCE(S) (CRIT2)
To satisfy this criterion there must be evidence of an intention to coerce,
intimidate, or convey some other message to a larger audience (or audiences)
than the immediate victims. Such evidence can include (but is not limited to) the
following: pre- or post-attack statements by the perpetrator(s), past behavior by
the perpetrators, or the particular nature of the target/victim, weapon, or attack
type.
1 = "Yes" The incident meets Criterion 2.
0 = "No" The incident does not meet Criterion 2 or no indication.
Criterion 3: OUTSIDE INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW (CRIT3)
Inclusion Criteria
15
GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE CODEBOOK ©UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND JUNE 2017
The action is outside the context of legitimate warfare activities, insofar as it
targets non-combatants (i.e. the act must be outside the parameters permitted
by international humanitarian law as reflected in the Additional Protocol to the
Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and elsewhere).
1 = "Yes" The incident meets Criterion 3.
0 = "No" The incident does not meet Criterion 3.
(doubtterr)
Categorical Variable
In certain cases there may be some uncertainty whether an incident meets all of the
criteria for inclusion. In these ambiguous cases, where there is a strong possibility, but
not certainty, that an incident represents an act of terrorism, the incident is included in
GTD and is coded as “Yes” for this variable.
1 = "Yes" There is doubt as to whether the incident is an act of terrorism.
0 = "No" There is essentially no doubt as to whether the incident is an act
of terrorism.
Note: This field is presently only systematically available with incidents occurring after
1997. If this variable was not included in the data collection process at the time the case
was coded, “-9” is recorded in the database.
(alternative; alternative_txt)
Categorical Variable
This variable applies to only those cases coded as “Yes” for “Doubt Terrorism Proper?”
(above). This variable identifies the most likely categorization of the incident other than
terrorism.
1= Insurgency/Guerilla Action
2= Other Crime Type
3= Inter/Intra-Group Conflict
4= Lack of Intentionality
 
Note: This field is presently only systematically available with incidents occurring after
1997.
Doubt Terrorism Proper?
Alternative Designation
16
GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE CODEBOOK ©UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND JUNE 2017
(multiple)
Categorical Variable
In those cases where several attacks are connected, but where the various actions do
not constitute a single incident (either the time of occurrence of incidents or their
locations are discontinuous – see Single Incident Determination section above), then
“Yes” is selected to denote that the particular attack was part of a “multiple” incident.
1 = "Yes" The attack is part of a multiple incident.
0 = "No" The attack is not part of a multiple incident.
Note: This field is presently only systematically available with incidents occurring after
1997.
Related Incidents
(related)
Text Variable
When an attack is part of a coordinated, multi-part incident the GTD IDs of the related
incidents are listed here, separated by commas.
Note: This field is presently only systematically available with incidents occurring after
1997.
III. Incident Location
(country; country_txt)
Categorical Variable
This field identifies the country or location where the incident occurred. Separatist
regions, such as Kashmir, Chechnya, South Ossetia, Transnistria, or Republic of Cabinda,
are coded as part of the “home” country.
In the case where the country in which an incident occurred cannot be identified, it is
coded as “Unknown.”
Note that the geo-political boundaries of many countries have changed over time. In a
number of cases, countries that represented the location of terrorist attacks no longer
exist; examples include West Germany, the USSR and Yugoslavia. In these cases the
Part of Multiple Incident
Country
17
GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE CODEBOOK ©UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND JUNE 2017
country name for the year the event occurred is recorded. As an example, a 1989 attack
in Bonn would be recorded as taking place in West Germany (FRG). An identical attack in
1991 would be recorded as taking place in Germany.

administrative region in which the event occurs.
(city)
Text Variable
Province / Administrative Region /State
City
 21
GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE CODEBOOK ©UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND JUNE 2017
This field contains the name of the city, village, or town in which the incident
occurred. If the city, village, or town for an incident is unknown, then this field
contains the smallest administrative area below provstate which can be found for
the incident (e.g., district).
(vicinity)
Categorical Variable
1 = "Yes" The incident occurred in the immediate vicinity of the city in
question.
0 = "No" The incident in the city itself.
(location)
Text Variable
This field is used to specify additional information about the location of the incident.
(latitude)
Numeric Variable
This field records the latitude (based on WGS1984 standards) of the city in which the
event occurred.
(longitude)
Numeric Variable
This field records the longitude (based on WGS1984 standards) of the city in which
the event occurred.

IV. Attack Information
(attacktype1; attacktype1_txt)
Categorical Variable
This field captures the general method of attack and often reflects the broad class of
tactics used. It consists of nine categories, which are defined below. Up to three
attack types can be recorded for each incident. Typically, only one attack type is
recorded for each incident unless the attack is comprised of a sequence of events.
When multiple attack types may apply, the most appropriate value is determined
based on the hierarchy below. For example, if an assassination is carried out through
the use of an explosive, the Attack Type is coded as Assassination, not
Bombing/Explosion. If an attack involves a sequence of events, then the first, the
second, and the third attack types are coded in the order of the hierarchy below
rather than the order in which they occurred.
Attack Type Hierarchy:
Assassination
Hijacking
Kidnapping
Barricade Incident
Bombing/Explosion
Armed Assault
Unarmed Assault
Facility/Infrastructure Attack
Unknown
1 = ASSASSINATION
Attack Type
 23
GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE CODEBOOK ©UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND JUNE 2017
An act whose primary objective is to kill one or more specific, prominent
individuals. Usually carried out on persons of some note, such as highranking
military officers, government officials, celebrities, etc. Not to include
attacks on non-specific members of a targeted group. The killing of a police
officer would be an armed assault unless there is reason to believe the
attackers singled out a particularly prominent officer for assassination.
2 = ARMED ASSAULT
An attack whose primary objective is to cause physical harm or death directly
to human beings by use of a firearm, incendiary, or sharp instrument (knife,
etc.). Not to include attacks involving the use of fists, rocks, sticks, or other
handheld (less-than-lethal) weapons. Also includes attacks involving certain
classes of explosive devices in addition to firearms, incendiaries, or sharp
instruments. The explosive device subcategories that are included in this
classification are grenades, projectiles, and unknown or other explosive
devices that are thrown.
3 = BOMBING/EXPLOSION
An attack where the primary effects are caused by an energetically unstable
material undergoing rapid decomposition and releasing a pressure wave that
causes physical damage to the surrounding environment. Can include either
high or low explosives (including a dirty bomb) but does not include a nuclear
explosive device that releases energy from fission and/or fusion, or an
incendiary device where decomposition takes place at a much slower rate.
If an attack involves certain classes of explosive devices along with firearms,
incendiaries, or sharp objects, then the attack is coded as an armed assault
only. The explosive device subcategories that are included in this
classification are grenades, projectiles, and unknown or other explosive
devices that are thrown in which the bombers are also using firearms or
incendiary devices.
4 = HIJACKING
An act whose primary objective is to take control of a vehicle such as an
aircraft, boat, bus, etc. for the purpose of diverting it to an unprogrammed
destination, force the release of prisoners, or some other political
objective. Obtaining payment of a ransom should not the sole purpose of a
Hijacking, but can be one element of the incident so long as additional
objectives have also been stated. Hijackings are distinct from Hostage Taking
because the target is a vehicle, regardless of whether there are
people/passengers in the vehicle.
5 = HOSTAGE TAKING (BARRICADE INCIDENT)
An act whose primary objective is to take control of hostages for the purpose
of achieving a political objective through concessions or through disruption 
 24
GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE CODEBOOK ©UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND JUNE 2017
of normal operations. Such attacks are distinguished from kidnapping since
the incident occurs and usually plays out at the target location with little or
no intention to hold the hostages for an extended period in a separate
clandestine location.
6 = HOSTAGE TAKING (KIDNAPPING)
An act whose primary objective is to take control of hostages for the purpose
of achieving a political objective through concessions or through disruption
of normal operations. Kidnappings are distinguished from Barricade Incidents
(above) in that they involve moving and holding the hostages in another
location.
7 = FACILITY / INFRASTRUCTURE ATTACK
An act, excluding the use of an explosive, whose primary objective is to cause
damage to a non-human target, such as a building, monument, train,
pipeline, etc. Such attacks include arson and various forms of sabotage (e.g.,
sabotaging a train track is a facility/infrastructure attack, even if passengers
are killed). Facility/infrastructure attacks can include acts which aim to harm
an installation, yet also cause harm to people incidentally (e.g. an arson
attack primarily aimed at damaging a building, but causes injuries or
fatalities).
8 = UNARMED ASSAULT
An attack whose primary objective is to cause physical harm or death directly
to human beings by any means other than explosive, firearm, incendiary, or
sharp instrument (knife, etc.). Attacks involving chemical, biological or
radiological weapons are considered unarmed assaults.
9 = UNKNOWN
The attack type cannot be determined from the available information.
(attacktype2; attacktype2_txt)
Categorical Variable
This variable utilizes the hierarchy and attack type definitions listed above.
(attacktype3; attacktype3_txt)
Categorical Variable
This variable utilizes the hierarchy and attack type definitions listed above
Second Attack Type
Third Attack Type
 25
GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE CODEBOOK ©UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND JUNE 2017
(success)
Categorical Variable
Success of a terrorist strike is defined according to the tangible effects of the attack.
Success is not judged in terms of the larger goals of the perpetrators. For example, a
bomb that exploded in a building would be counted as a success even if it did not
succeed in bringing the building down or inducing government repression.
The definition of a successful attack depends on the type of attack. Essentially, the
key question is whether or not the attack type took place. If a case has multiple
attack types, it is successful if any of the attack types are successful, with the
exception of assassinations, which are only successful if the intended target is killed.
1 = "Yes" The incident was successful.
0 = "No" The incident was not successful.
ASSASSINATION
In order for an assassination to be successful, the target of the assassination must be
killed. For example, even if an attack kills numerous people but not the target, it is
an unsuccessful assassination.
ARMED ASSAULT
An armed assault is determined to be successful if the assault takes place and if a
target is hit (including people and/or property). Unsuccessful armed assaults are
those in which the perpetrators attack and do not hit the target. An armed assault is
also unsuccessful if the perpetrators are apprehended on their way to commit the
assault. To make this determination, however, there must be information to indicate
that an actual assault was imminent.
BOMBING/EXPLOSION
A bombing is successful if the bomb or explosive device detonates. Bombings are
considered unsuccessful if they do not detonate. The success or failure of the
bombing is not based on whether it hit the intended target.
HIJACKING
A hijacking is successful if the hijackers assume control of the vehicle at any point,
whereas a hijacking is unsuccessful if the hijackers fail to assume control of the
vehicle. The success or failure of the hijacking is not based on whether the vehicle
reached the intended destination of the hijackers.
HOSTAGE TAKING (BARRICADE INCIDENT)
Successful Attack
 26
GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE CODEBOOK ©UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND JUNE 2017
A barricade incident is successful if the hostage takers assume control of the
individuals at any point, whereas a barricade incident is unsuccessful if the hostage
takers fail to assume control of the individuals.
HOSTAGE TAKING (KIDNAPPING)
A kidnapping is successful if the kidnappers assume control of the individuals at any
point, whereas a kidnapping is unsuccessful if the kidnappers fail to assume control
of the individuals.
FACILITY / INFRASTRUCTURE ATTACK
A facility attack is determined to be successful if the facility is damaged. If the facility
has not been damaged, then the attack is unsuccessful.
UNARMED ASSAULT
An unarmed assault is determined to be successful there is a victim that who has
been injured. Unarmed assaults that are unsuccessful are those in which the
perpetrators do not injure anyone. An unarmed assault is also unsuccessful if the
perpetrators are apprehended when on their way to commit the assault. To make
this determination, however, there must be information to indicate that an assault
was imminent.
(suicide)
Categorical Variable
This variable is coded “Yes” in those cases where there is evidence that the

VI. Target/Victim Information
Information on up to three targets/victims is recorded for each incident. The
target/victim information fields coded for each of the three targets include type,
name of entity, specific target/victim, and nationality of the target/victim. The field
contains information on both intended targets and incidental bystanders, and
therefore, intentionality should be carefully considered.
(targtype1; targtype1_txt)
Categorical Variable
The target/victim type field captures the general type of target/victim. When a
victim is attacked specifically because of his or her relationship to a particular
person, such as a prominent figure, the target type reflects that motive. For
example, if a family member of a government official is attacked because of his or
her relationship to that individual, the type of target is “government.” This variable
consists of the following 22 categories:
1 = BUSINESS
Businesses are defined as individuals or organizations engaged in commercial or
mercantile activity as a means of livelihood. Any attack on a business or private
citizens patronizing a business such as a restaurant, gas station, music store, bar,
café, etc.
This includes attacks carried out against corporate offices or employees of firms like
mining companies, or oil corporations. Furthermore, includes attacks conducted on
business people or corporate officers. Included in this value as well are hospitals and
chambers of commerce and cooperatives.
Does not include attacks carried out in public or quasi-public areas such as “business
district or commercial area”, or generic business-related individuals such as
“businessmen” (these attacks are captured under “Private Citizens and Property”,
see below.) Also does not include attacks against generic business-related
individuals such as “businessmen.” Unless the victims were targeted because of their
specific business affiliation, these attacks belong in “Private Citizens and Property.”
2 = GOVERNMENT (GENERAL)

including members of political parties in official capacities, their convoys, or events
sponsored by political parties; political movements; or a government sponsored
institution where the attack is expressly carried out to harm the government.
Target/Victim Type
 32
GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE CODEBOOK ©UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND JUNE 2017
This value includes attacks on judges, public attorneys (e.g., prosecutors), courts and
court systems, politicians, royalty, head of state, government employees (unless
police or military), election-related attacks, or intelligence agencies and spies.

Excludes attacks against non-state militias and guerrillas, these types of attacks are
coded as “Terrorist/Non-state Militias” see below.
5 = ABORTION RELATED
Attacks on abortion clinics, employees, patrons, or security personnel stationed at
clinics.
6 = AIRPORTS & AIRCRAFT
An attack that was carried out either against an aircraft or against an airport. Attacks

aircraft are not included.
7 = GOVERNMENT (DIPLOMATIC)
Attacks carried out against foreign missions, including embassies, consulates, etc.
This value includes cultural centers that have diplomatic functions, and attacks
against diplomatic staff and their families (when the relationship is relevant to the
motive of the attack) and property. The United Nations is a diplomatic target.
8 = EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION
Attacks against schools, teachers, or guards protecting school sites. Includes attacks
against university professors, teaching staff and school buses. Moreover, includes
attacks against religious schools in this value. 
 33
GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE CODEBOOK ©UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND JUNE 2017
As noted below in the “Private Citizens and Property” value, the GTD has several
attacks against students. If attacks involving students are not expressly against a
school, university or other educational institution or are carried out in an
educational setting, they are coded as private citizens and property.
Excludes attacks against military schools (attacks on military schools are coded as
“Military,” see below).
9 = FOOD OR WATER SUPPLY
Attacks on food or water supplies or reserves are included in this value. This
generally includes attacks aimed at the infrastructure related to food and water for
human consumption.
10 = JOURNALISTS & MEDIA
Includes, attacks on reporters, news assistants, photographers, publishers, as well as
attacks on media headquarters and offices.

GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE CODEBOOK ©UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND JUNE 2017
Also includes ambiguous cases where the target/victim was a named individual, or
where the target/victim of an attack could be identified by name, age, occupation,
gender or nationality. This value also includes ceremonial events, such as weddings
and funerals.
The GTD contains a number of attacks against students. If these attacks are not
expressly against a school, university or other educational institution or are not
carried out in an educational setting, these attacks are coded using this value. Also,
includes incidents involving political supporters as private citizens and property,
provided that these supporters are not part of a government-sponsored event.
Finally, this value includes police informers.
Does not include attacks causing civilian casualties in businesses such as restaurants,
cafes or movie theaters (these categories are coded as “Business” see above).
15 = RELIGIOUS FIGURES/INSTITUTIONS
This value includes attacks on religious leaders, (Imams, priests, bishops, etc.),
religious institutions (mosques, churches), religious places or objects (shrines, relics,
etc.). This value also includes attacks on organizations that are affiliated with
religious entities that are not NGOs, businesses or schools.
Attacks on religious pilgrims are considered “Private Citizens and Property;” attacks
on missionaries are considered religious figures.
16 = TELECOMMUNICATION
This includes attacks on facilities and infrastructure for the transmission of
information. More specifically this value includes things like cell phone towers,
telephone booths, television transmitters, radio, and microwave towers.
17 = TERRORISTS/NON-STATE MILITIAS
Terrorists or members of identified terrorist groups within the GTD are included in
this value. Membership is broadly defined and includes informants for terrorist
groups, but excludes former or surrendered terrorists.
This value also includes cases involving the targeting of militias and guerillas.
18 = TOURISTS
This value includes the targeting of tour buses, tourists, or “tours.” Tourists are
persons who travel primarily for the purposes of leisure or amusement. Government
tourist offices are included in this value.
 35
GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE CODEBOOK ©UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND JUNE 2017
The attack must clearly target tourists, not just an assault on a business or
transportation system used by tourists. Travel agencies are coded as business
targets.
19 = TRANSPORTATION (OTHER THAN AVIATION)
Attacks on public transportation systems are included in this value. This can include
efforts to assault public buses, minibuses, trains, metro/subways, highways (if the
highway itself is the target of the attack), bridges, roads, etc.
The GTD contains a number of attacks on generic terms such as “cars” or “vehicles.”
These attacks are assumed to be against “Private Citizens and Property” unless
shown to be against public transportation systems. In this regard, buses are
assumed to be public transportation unless otherwise noted.
20 = UNKNOWN
The target type cannot be determined from the available information.
21 = UTILITIES
This value pertains to facilities for the transmission or generation of energy. For
example, power lines, oil pipelines, electrical transformers, high tension lines, gas
and electric substations, are all included in this value. This value also includes
lampposts or street lights.
Attacks on officers, employees or facilities of utility companies excluding the type of
facilities above are coded as business.
22 = VIOLENT POLITICAL PARTIES
This value pertains to entities that are both political parties (and thus, coded as
“government” in this coding scheme) and terrorists. It is operationally defined as
groups that engage in electoral politics and appear as “Perpetrators” in the GTD.

VII. Perpetrator Information
Information on up to three perpetrators is recorded for each incident. This includes
the perpetrator group name and the perpetrator group sub-name, as well as details
about any claims of responsibility for the attack. Note that the perpetrator
attributions recorded for each attack reflect what is reported in open-source media
accounts, which does not necessarily indicate a legal finding of culpability.
(gname)
Text Variable
This field contains the name of the group that carried out the attack. In order to
ensure consistency in the usage of group names for the database, the GTD database
uses a standardized list of group names that have been established by project staff
to serve as a reference for all subsequent entries.

GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE CODEBOOK ©UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND JUNE 2017
In the event that the name of a formal perpetrator group or organization is not
reported in source materials, this field may contain relevant information about the
generic identity of the perpetrator(s) (e.g., “Protestant Extremists”). Note that these
categories do not represent discrete entities. They are not exhaustive or mutually
exclusive (e.g., “student radicals” and “left-wing militants” may describe the same
people). They also do not characterize the behavior of an entire population or
ideological movement. For many attacks, generic identifiers are the only information
available about the perpetrators. Because of this they are included in the database
to provide context; however, analysis of generic identifiers should be interpreted
with caution.
If no information about the perpetrator group is available, this field is coded as
“Unknown.”
(gsubname)
Text Variable
This field contains any additional qualifiers or details about the name of the group
that carried out the attack. This includes but is not limited to the name of the
specific faction when available.

Categorical Variable
This variable indicates whether or not the information reported by sources about
the Perpetrator Group Name(s) is based on speculation or dubious claims of
responsibility.
1 = "Yes" The perpetrator attribution(s) for the incident are suspected.
0 = "No" The perpetrator attribution(s) for the incident are not
suspected.

Conventions follow “First Perpetrator Group Suspected/Unconfirmed?”
Unaffiliated Individual(s)
(individual)
Categorical Variable
This variable indicates whether or not the attack was carried out by an individual or
several individuals not known to be affiliated with a group or organization. This
information should be interpreted with caution, because it is likely that assailants
who might be characterized as “unaffiliated individuals” are frequently unidentified.
1 = "Yes" The perpetrator(s) were identified by name (or specific
unnamed minors) and not known to be affiliated with a group
or organization.
0 = "No" The perpetrator(s) were not identified as unaffiliated
individuals (i.e. the perpetrators were either not identified by
name, or were known to be affiliated with a group or
organization).
Note: This field is presently only systematically available with incidents occurring
after 1997.
(nperps)
Numeric Variable
This field indicates the total number of terrorists participating in the incident. (In the
instance of multiple perpetrator groups participating in one case, the total number
of perpetrators, across groups, is recorded). There are often discrepancies in
information on this value.
Where several independent credible sources report different numbers of attackers,
the value of this variable reflects the number given by the majority of sources,
unless there is reason to do otherwise. Where there is no majority figure among
independent sources, the database records the lowest proffered perpetrator figure,
unless there is clear reason to do otherwise. In cases where the number of
Number of Perpetrators
 45
GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE CODEBOOK ©UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND JUNE 2017
perpetrators is stated vaguely, for example “…at least 11 attackers”, then the lowest
possible number is recorded, in this example, “11.” “-99” or “Unknown” appears
when the number of perpetrators is not reported.
(nperpcap)
Numeric Variable
This field records the number of perpetrators taken into custody. “-99” or
“Unknown” appears when there is evidence of captured, but the number is not
reported.
Divergent reports on the number of perpetrators captured are dealt with in same
manner used for the Number of Perpetrators variable described above.
Note: This field is presently only systematically available with incidents occurring
after 1997.
(claimed)
Categorical Variable
This field is used to indicate whether a group or person(s) claimed responsibility for
the attack. If marked “Yes”, it indicates that a person or a group did in fact claim
responsibility. When there are multiple perpetrator groups involved, this field refers
to the First Perpetrator Group (separate fields for the Second and Third groups
follow below).
1 = "Yes" A group or person claimed responsibility for the attack.
0 = "No" No claim of responsibility was made.
Note: This field is presently only systematically available with incidents occurring
after 1997.
(claimmode; claimmode_txt)
Categorical Variable
This records one of 10 modes used by claimants to claim responsibility and might be
useful to verify authenticity, track trends in behavior, etc. If greater detail exists (for
instance, a particularly novel or strange mode is used) this information is captured in
the “Additional Notes” field.
Mode Values:

Categorical Variable
This field is used to indicate whether more than one group claimed separate
responsibility for the attack. If marked “Yes”, it indicates that the groups entered in
conjunction with the case each claimed responsibility for the attack (i.e., they did
not work together, but each independently tried to claim credit for the attack).
1 = "Yes" There are competing claims of responsibility for the attack.
0 = "No" There are not competing claims of responsibility for the
attack.
-9= “Unknown No indication of competing claims.

(motive)
Text Variable
When reports explicitly mention a specific motive for the attack, this motive is
recorded in the “Motive” field. This field may also include general information about
the political, social, or economic climate at the time of the attack if considered
relevant to the motivation underlying the incident.

Numeric Variable
Third Group Claim of Responsibility?
Mode for Third Group Claim of Responsibility

Total Number of Fatalities
 48
GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE CODEBOOK ©UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND JUNE 2017
This field stores the number of total confirmed fatalities for the incident. The
number includes all victims and attackers who died as a direct result of the incident.
Where there is evidence of fatalities, but a figure is not reported or it is too vague to
be of use, this field remains blank. If information is missing regarding the number of
victims killed in an attack, but perpetrator fatalities are known, this value will reflect
only the number of perpetrators who died as a result of the incident. Likewise, if
information on the number of perpetrators killed in an attack is missing, but victim
fatalities are known, this field will only report the number of victims killed in the
incident.
Where several independent sources report different numbers of casualties, the
database will usually reflect the number given by the most recent source. However,
the most recent source will not be used if the source itself is of questionable validity
or if the source bases its casualty numbers on claims made by a perpetrator group.
When there are several “most recent” sources published around the same time, or
there are concerns about the validity of a recent source, the majority figure will be
used. Where there is no majority figure among independent sources, the database
will record the lowest proffered fatality figure, unless that figure comes from a
source of questionable validity or there is another compelling reason to do
otherwise. Conflicting reports of fatalities will be noted in the “Additional Notes”
field.
Note: Preservation of Statistical Accuracy
When several cases are linked together, sources sometimes provide a cumulative
fatality total for all of the events rather than fatality figures for each incident. In such
cases, the preservation of statistical accuracy is achieved by distributing fatalities
across the linked incidents. It will be noted in the “Additional Notes” field whenever
cumulative totals are divided across multiple events. This method for preserving
statistical accuracy is also used for calculating the values for the following fields
when individual event totals are unknown: “Number of U.S. Fatalities,” “Number of
Perpetrator Fatalities,” “Total Number of Injured,” “Number of U.S. Injured,” and
“Number of Perpetrators Injured.”
(nkillus)
Numeric Variable
This field records the number of U.S. citizens who died as a result of the incident,
and follows the conventions of “Total Number of Fatalities” described above. Thus,
this field records the number of U.S. victims and U.S. perpetrators who died as a
result of the attack. The value for this field is not limited to U.S. citizens killed on U.S.
soil, but also includes U.S. citizens who died in incidents occurring outside of the U.S.

GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE CODEBOOK ©UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND JUNE 2017
Number of Perpetrator Fatalities
(nkillter)
Numeric Variable
Limited to only perpetrator fatalities, this field follows the conventions of the “Total
Number of Fatalities” field described above.
(nwound)
Numeric Variable
This field records the number of confirmed non-fatal injuries to both perpetrators
and victims. It follows the conventions of the “Total Number of Fatalities” field
described above.
(nwoundus)
Numeric Variable
This field records the number of confirmed non-fatal injuries to U.S. citizens, both
perpetrators and victims. It follows the conventions of the “Number of U.S.
Fatalities” field described above.
(nwoundte)
Numeric Variable
Conventions follow the “Number of Perpetrator Fatalities” field described above.
(property)
Categorical Variable
“Yes” appears if there is evidence of property damage from the incident.
1 = "Yes" The incident resulted in property damage.
0 = "No" The incident did not result in property damage.
-9 = "Unknown" It is unknown if the incident resulted in property
damage.

GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE CODEBOOK ©UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND JUNE 2017
If “Property Damage?” is “Yes,” then one of the following four categories describes
the extent of the property damage:
1 = Catastrophic (likely > $1 billion)
2 = Major (likely > $1 million but < $1 billion)
3 = Minor (likely < $1 million)
4 = Unknown
Value of Property Damage (in USD)
(propvalue)
Numeric Variable
If “Property Damage?” is “Yes,” then the exact U.S. dollar amount (at the time of the
incident) of total damages is listed. Where applicable, property values reported in
foreign currencies are converted to U.S. dollars before being entered into the GTD. If
no dollar figure is reported, the field is left blank. That is, a blank field here does not
indicate that there was no property damage but, rather, that no precise estimate of
the value was available. The value of damages only includes direct economic effects
of the incident (i.e. cost of buildings, etc.) and not indirect economic costs (longer
term effects on the company, industry, tourism, etc.).
Protocols for recording inconsistent numbers, etc., listed above are followed (see,
for example, “Number of Perpetrators”).
Property Damage Comments
(propcomment)
Text Variable
If “Property Damage?” is “Yes,” then non-monetary or imprecise measures of
damage may be described in this field. This field is also used to list specific details
about the property that was damaged in an attack, such as the type of vehicle that
was destroyed, the areas or parts of a building that were damaged, or the types of
assets that were stolen.
(ishostkid)
Categorical Variable
This field records whether or not the victims were taken hostage (i.e. held against
their will) or kidnapped (i.e. held against their will and taken to another location)
during an incident.
1 = "Yes" The victims were taken hostage or kidnapped.
0 = "No" The victims were not taken hostage or kidnapped.
Hostages or Kidnapping Victims
 51
GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE CODEBOOK ©UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND JUNE 2017
-9 = "Unknown" It is unknown if the victims were taken hostage or
kidnapped.
(nhostkid)
Numeric Variable
This field records the total number of hostages or kidnapping victims. For successful
hijackings, this value will reflect the total number of crew members and passengers
aboard the vehicle at the time of the incident.
As with other fields, where several independent sources report different numbers of
hostages, the GTD reflects the number given by the most recent source, unless there
is reason to do otherwise. When there are several most recent sources available, or
there are question about the validity of a recent source, the GTD will report the
majority figure from a group of independent sources. Where there is no majority
figure among independent sources, the database will record the lowest proffered
hostage figure, unless there is clear reason to do otherwise.
In cases where the number of hostages or kidnapping victims is stated vaguely, for
example, “…at least 11 hostages”, then the lowest possible number will be recorded,
in this example “11.” If the number of hostages is unknown or unidentified, this field
records “-99” (unknown).
U.S. Hostages or Kidnapping Victims
(ishostkidus)
Categorical Variable
This field records whether or not U.S. citizens were taken hostage (i.e. held against
their will) or kidnapped (i.e. held against their will and taken to another location)
during an incident.
1 = "Yes" U.S. citizens were taken hostage or kidnapped.
0 = "No" U.S. citizens were not taken hostage or kidnapped.
-9 = "Unknown" It is unknown if U.S. citizens were taken hostage or
kidnapped.
Number of U.S. Hostages/ Kidnapping Victims

GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE CODEBOOK ©UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND JUNE 2017
(nhours)
Numeric Variable
If the “Attack Type” is “Hostage Taking (Kidnapping),” “Hostage Taking (Barricade
Incident),” or a successful “Hijacking,” then the duration of the incident is recorded
either in this field or in the next field depending on whether the incident lasted a
matter of hours or days. If neither hours nor days are known, both fields are coded
as “-99” (unknown).
If the incident lasted for less than 24 hours, this field records the approximate
number of hours.
If the incident lasted for more than 24 hours (i.e., at least one day), then the
approximate number of days is recorded in the next field.
Days of Kidnapping / Hostage Incident
(ndays)
Numeric Variable
If the “Attack Type” is “Hostage Taking (Kidnapping),” “Hostage Taking (Barricade
Incident),” or (successful) “Hijacking” and if the duration of the kidnapping / hostage
incident last for more than 24 hours, this field records the duration of the incident in
days. If information on hours and days is provided, the figure is rounded to the
nearest day.
(divert)
Text Variable
If the “Attack Type” is “Hostage Taking (Kidnapping)” or “Hijacking” then this field
will list the country that hijackers diverted a vehicle to, or the country that the
kidnap victims were moved to and held. If hijackers did not divert a vehicle to
another country, this field is blank. If a vehicle was diverted to multiple countries,
this field will record the first country that the vehicle was diverted to, and the others
will be listed in the “Additional Notes” field.
(kidhijcountry)
Text Variable
If the “Attack Type” is “Hostage Taking (Kidnapping)” or “Hijacking” then this field
lists the country in which the incident was resolved or ended. If the incident was not

resolved in another country, this field is blank. If a vehicle was diverted to more than
one country, this field will record the last country that it was diverted to, and the
others will be listed in the “Additional Notes” field.
(ransom)
Categorical Variable
1 = "Yes" The incident involved a demand of monetary ransom.
0 = "No" The incident did not involve a demand of monetary
ransom.
-9 = "Unknown" It is unknown if the incident involved a demand of
monetary ransom.
[NULL] Not applicable
Total Ransom Amount Demanded
(ransomamt)
Numeric Variable
If a ransom was demanded, then the amount (in U.S. dollars) is listed in this field. If a
ransom was demanded but the monetary figure is unknown, then this field will
report “-99” (unknown). If there are conflicting reports on the amount of ransom
demanded, the majority figure from independent sources will be used. If no majority
exists, the lowest proffered figure will be used, unless that figure comes from a
source of questionable validity or there is another compelling reason to do
otherwise.

listed in this field. If a ransom was demanded from U.S. sources but the monetary
Ransom Demanded
 54
GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE CODEBOOK ©UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND JUNE 2017
figure is unknown, then this field will report “-99” (unknown). If there are conflicting
reports on the amount of ransom demanded from a U.S. source, the majority figure
from independent sources will be used. If no majority exists, the lowest proffered
figure will be used, unless there is a reason to do otherwise.
Total Ransom Amount Paid
(ransompaid)
Numeric Variable
If a ransom amount was paid, then the amount (in U.S. dollars) is listed in this field.
If a ransom was paid but the monetary figure was unspecified, then this field will
report “-99” (unknown). A value of “-99” will also be reported for any case where it
is suspected that a ransom was paid, but it has not been confirmed. If there are
conflicting reports on the amount of ransom paid, the majority figure from
independent sources will be used. If no majority exists, the lowest proffered figure
will be used, unless that figure comes from a source of questionable validity or there
is another compelling reason to do otherwise.
Ransom Amount Paid By U.S. Sources
(ransompaidus)
Numeric Variable
If a ransom amount was paid by U.S. sources, then this figure is listed in U.S. dollars.
If a ransom was paid by U.S. sources but the monetary figure was unspecified, then
this field will report “-99” (unknown). If there are conflicting reports on the amount
of ransom paid by a U.S. source, the majority figure from independent sources will
be used. If no majority exists, the lowest proffered figure will be used, unless that
figure comes from a source of questionable validity or there is another compelling
reason to do otherwise.
(ransomnote)
Text Variable
This field is used to record any specific details relating to a ransom that are not
captured in the other fields. This includes any information about non-money
demands made by perpetrators, as well as information on conflicting reports of how
much money was demanded and/or paid.
Note: This field is presently only systematically available with incidents occurring
after 1997.

Ransom Notes
Kidnapping/Hostage Outcome
 55
GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE CODEBOOK ©UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND JUNE 2017
Categorical Variable
This field captures the eventual fate of hostages and kidnap victims. If the “Attack
Type” is “Hostage Taking (Kidnapping),”“Hostage Taking (Barricade Incident),” or a
successful “Hijacking,” then this field applies. The seven values for this field are:
1 = Attempted Rescue
2 = Hostage(s) released by perpetrators
3 = Hostage(s) escaped (not during rescue attempt)
4 = Hostage(s) killed (not during rescue attempt)
5 = Successful Rescue
6 = Combination
7 = Unknown
Number Released/Escaped/Rescued
(nreleased)
Numeric Variable
If the “Attack Type” is “Hostage Taking (Kidnapping),” “Hostage Taking (Barricade
Incident),” or a successful “Hijacking,” then this field will apply. This field records the
number of hostages who survived the incident.
As with the total number of kidnapping victims, where several independent sources
report different numbers of hostages, the database will reflect the number given by
the most recent source, unless there is reason to do otherwise. If there are several
most recent sources available, the majority number form a group of independent
sources will be used, unless there is reason to do otherwise. Where there is no
majority figure among independent sources, the database will record the lowest
proffered hostage released/escaped/rescued figure, unless there is clear reason to
do otherwise.
In cases where the number of hostages released/escaped/rescued is stated vaguely,
for example “…at least 11 hostages were released”, then the lowest possible
number will be recorded, in this example “11.” If the fate of the hostages is
unknown, this field will record “-99.”
IX. Additional Information and Sources
(addnotes)
Text Variable
Additional Notes
 56
GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE CODEBOOK ©UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND JUNE 2017
This field is used to capture additional relevant details about the attack. It may
include any of the following information:
 Additional information that could not be captured in any of the above fields,
such as details about hostage conditions or additional countries hijacked
vehicles were diverted to.
 Supplemental important information not specific to the particular attack,
such as multiple attacks in the same area or by the same perpetrator.
 Uncertainties about the data (such as differing reports of casualty numbers,
aggregated casualty numbers split across multiple incidents, or uncertainty
about perpetrators responsible).
 Unusual factors, such as a shift in tactics, the reappearance of an
organization, the emergence of a new organization, an attack carried out on
a historical date, or an escalation of a violent campaign.
 The fate (legal, health, or otherwise) of either victims or perpetrators where
this is mentioned in GTD source documents.
 In addition, the instructions for several fields listed above have specific
indications for placing additional information in the “Additional Notes” field,
as needed:
- Specific Target/Victim
If the Target/Victim is multiple victims (e.g., in a kidnapping or
assassination), up to three names are recorded in the “Specific
Target/Victim” field, with remaining names recorded in the “Additional
Notes” field.
- Perpetrator Individual(s)’ Name(s)
Names of individuals identified as planners, bomb-makers, etc., who are
indirectly involved in an attack, may recorded in the “Additional Notes”
field.
- Mode for Claim of Responsibility
If greater detail is needed than provided for the “Mode for Claim of
Responsibility” field (for instance, a particularly novel or strange mode is
used) this information may be captured in the “Additional Notes” field.
- Kidnapping/Hostage Outcome
If greater detail is available than the Kidnapping/Hostage Outcome field
allows, then further details about the fate of hostages/kidnapped may be
recorded in the “Additional Notes” field.
 Notes if an attack has been marked as “doubt terrorism proper” and provides
explanation of reasons (excluding cases where Alternative Designation =
Insurgency).

Note: This field is presently only systematically available with incidents occurring
after 1997.
International- Logistical
(INT_LOG)
Categorical Variable
This variable is based on a comparison between the nationality of the perpetrator
group and the location of the attack. It indicates whether a perpetrator group
crossed a border to carry out an attack. Typically the border is a national border,
however in cases where perpetrator groups represent non-contiguous contested
territory (e.g., Puerto Rico, Corsica, Northern Ireland) or a secure border (e.g., West
Bank and Gaza Strip) the nationality of the perpetrator group is coded as the
contested territory and attacks against the parent country are coded as logistically
international.
1 = "Yes" The attack was logistically international; the nationality of the
perpetrator group differs from the location of the attack. If
the perpetrator group is multinational, the attack is logistically
international if all of the group’s nationalities differ from the
location of the attack.
0 = "No" The attack was logistically domestic; the nationality of the
perpetrator group is the same as the location of the attack. If
the perpetrator group is multinational, the attack is logistically
domestic if any of the group’s nationalities is the same as the
location of the attack.
-9 = "Unknown" It is unknown if the attack was logistically international or
domestic; the nationality of the perpetrator group is
unknown.
Note: The nationality of the perpetrator group is not included in the GTD, but was
collected as an auxiliary variable for the purpose of coding the
international/domestic variables. It is not available for distribution.
Also, perpetrator nationality is only identified for groups or organizations, not for
individual perpetrators. For cases where the perpetrator group is unidentified, or
the attack was carried out by unaffiliated individuals, the nationality of the
perpetrator group is unknown.
International- Ideological
(INT_IDEO)
Categorical Variable
 58
GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE CODEBOOK ©UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND JUNE 2017
This variable is based on a comparison between the nationality of the perpetrator
group and the nationality of the target(s)/victim(s). It indicates whether a
perpetrator group attacked a target of a different nationality. Unlike the logistically
international variable, in cases where perpetrator groups represent non-contiguous
contested territory (e.g., Puerto Rico, Corsica, Northern Ireland) or a secure border
(e.g., West Bank and Gaza Strip) the nationality of the perpetrator group is coded as
the parent country and attacks against the parent country are coded as ideologically
domestic.
1 = "Yes" The attack was ideologically international; the nationality of
the perpetrator group differs from the nationality of the
target(s)/victim(s). If the perpetrator group or target is
multinational, the attack is ideologically international.
0 = "No" The attack was ideologically domestic; any and all nationalities
of the perpetrator group are the same as the nationalities of
the target(s)/victim(s).
-9 = "Unknown" It is unknown if the attack was logistically international or
domestic; the nationality of the perpetrator group or the
nationality of the target/victim is unknown.
Note: The nationality of the perpetrator group is not included in the GTD, but was
collected as an auxiliary variable for the purpose of coding the
international/domestic variables. It is not available for distribution.
Also, perpetrator nationality is only identified for groups or organizations, not for
individual perpetrators. For cases where the perpetrator group is unidentified, or
the attack was carried out by unaffiliated individuals, the nationality of the
perpetrator group is unknown.
International- Miscellaneous
(INT_MISC)
Categorical Variable
This variable is based on a comparison between the location of the attack and the
nationality of the target(s)/victim(s). It indicates whether a perpetrator group
attacked a target of a different nationality. Unlike the logistically international and
ideologically international variables, it does not require information about the
nationality of the perpetrator group. If an attack is international on this dimension, it
is necessarily also either logistically international or ideologically international, but it
is not clear which one. If an attack is domestic on this dimension, it may also be
logistically international or ideologically international, or domestic on all
dimensions.
 59
GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE CODEBOOK ©UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND JUNE 2017
1 = "Yes" The attack was miscellaneous international; the location of
the attack differs from the nationality of the
target(s)/victim(s).
0 = "No" The attack was miscellaneous domestic; the location of the
attack is the same as the nationalities of the
target(s)/victim(s).
-9 = "Unknown" It is unknown if the attack was miscellaneous international or
domestic; the nationality of target/victim is unknown.
International- Any of the above
(INT_ANY)
Categorical Variable
1 = "Yes" The attack was international on any of the dimensions
described above (logistically, ideologically, miscellaneous)
0 = "No" The attack was domestic on all of the dimensions described
above (logistically, ideologically, miscellaneous);
-9 = "Unknown" It is unknown if the attack was international or domestic; the
value for one or more dimensions is unknown.

(dbsource)
Text Variable
This field identifies the original data collection effort in which each event was
recorded. Each value corresponds to a different data collection project or group. The
three largest (PGIS, CETIS, and ISVG) correspond to the original collection efforts for
GTD1, GTD2, and GTD3, respectively. The additional values correspond to
retrospective data collection efforts undertaken by START as part of larger research
projects at the center. The originating source in those projects was used to identify
cases that were not in the GTD but could be identified in other reputable media
sources. These cases were then researched, sourced, and added to the GTD.
