Under such method, during the time period in which the timing differences for the property reverse, the amount of the adjustment to the reserve for the deferred taxes is calculated by multiplying\u2014\n(i) the ratio of the aggregate deferred taxes for the property to the aggregate timing differences for the property as of the beginning of the period in question, by\n(ii) the amount of the timing differences which reverse during such period.\n(C) ALTERNATIVE METHOD.\u2014The \u201calternative method\u201d is the method in which the taxpayer\u2014\n(i) computes the excess tax reserve on all public utility property included in the plant account on the basis of the weighted average life or composite rate used to compute depreciation for regulatory purposes, and\n(ii) reduces the excess tax reserve ratably over the remaining regulatory life of the property.\n(4) TAX INCREASED FOR NORMALIZATION VIOLATION.\u2014If, for any taxable year ending after the date of the enactment of this Act, the taxpayer does not use a normalization method of accounting for the corporate rate reductions provided in the amendments made by this section\u2014\n(A) the taxpayer's tax for the taxable year shall be increased by the amount by which it reduces its excess tax reserve more rapidly than permitted under a normalization method of accounting, and\n(B) such taxpayer shall not be treated as using a normalization method of accounting for purposes of subsections (f)(2) and (i)(9)(C) of section 168 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\nSEC. 13002.

A notice of determination of other agency course shall include information required by paragraph (1)(D) to be included in a notice of proposed rule making and a description of the alternative response the agency determined to adopt.\n\u201c(B) If in its determination of other agency course the agency makes a determination to amend or rescind an existing rule, the agency need not undertake additional proceedings under subsection (c) before it publishes a notice of proposed rule making to amend or rescind the existing rule.\nAll information provided to or considered by the agency, and steps to obtain information by the agency, in connection with its determination of other agency course, including but not limited to any preliminary risk assessment or regulatory impact analysis prepared by the agency and all other information that would be required to be prepared or described by the agency under paragraph (1)(D) if the agency had determined to publish a notice of proposed rule making and, at the discretion of the President or the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, information provided by that Office in consultations with the agency, shall be placed in the docket for the determination and made accessible to the public by electronic means and otherwise for the public\u2019s use when the notice of determination is published.\n\u201c(3) After notice of proposed rule making required by this section, the agency shall provide interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule making through submission of written data, views, or arguments with or without opportunity for oral presentation, except that\u2014\n\u201c(A) if a hearing is required under paragraph (4)(B) or subsection (e), opportunity for oral presentation shall be provided pursuant to that requirement; or\n\u201c(B) when other than under subsection (e) of this section rules are required by statute or at the discretion of the agency to be made on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing, sections 556 and 557 shall apply, and paragraph (4), the requirements of subsection (e) to receive comment outside of the procedures of sections 556 and 557, and the petition procedures of subsection (e)(6) shall not apply.\nThe agency shall provide not fewer than 60 days for interested persons to submit written data, views, or argument (or 120 days in the case of a proposed major or high-impact rule).\n\u201c(4) (A) Within 30 days of publication of notice of proposed rule making, a member of the public may petition for a hearing in accordance with section 556 to determine whether any evidence or other information upon which the agency bases the proposed rule fails to comply with the Information Quality Act.\n\u201c(B) (i) The agency may, upon review of the petition, determine without further process to exclude from the rule making the evidence or other information that is the subject of the petition and, if appropriate, withdraw the proposed rule. The agency shall promptly publish any such determination.\n\u201c(ii) If the agency does not resolve the petition under the procedures of clause (i), it shall grant any such petition that presents a prima facie case that evidence or other information upon which the agency bases the proposed rule fails to comply with the Information Quality Act, hold the requested hearing not later than 30 days after receipt of the petition, provide a reasonable opportunity for cross-examination at the hearing, and decide the issues presented by the petition not later than 60 days after receipt of the petition. The agency may deny any petition that it determines does not present such a prima facie case.\n\u201c(C) There shall be no judicial review of the agency\u2019s disposition of issues considered and decided or determined under subparagraph (B)(ii) until judicial review of the agency\u2019s final action. There shall be no judicial review of an agency\u2019s determination to withdraw a proposed rule under subparagraph (B)(i) on the basis of the petition.\n\u201c(D) Failure to petition for a hearing under this paragraph shall not preclude judicial review of any claim based on the Information Quality Act under chapter 7 of this title.\n\u201c(5) After notice or advance notice of a proposed rule making, the agency making the rule, and any person acting in an official capacity on behalf of the agency, may not communicate, and a person who receives Federal funds from the agency may not use those funds to communicate, through written, oral, electronic, or other means to the public about the proposed rule in a manner that\u2014\n\u201c(A) directly advocates, in support of or against the proposed rule, for the submission of information to form part of the record of review for the proposed rule;\n\u201c(B) appeals to the public, or solicits a third-party, to undertake advocacy in support of or against the proposed rule; or\n\u201c(C) is directly or indirectly for publicity or propaganda purposes within the United States not heretofore authorized by the Congress.\nSuch prohibition shall not apply to communication that requests comments or provides information regarding the rule in an impartial manner.\n\u201c(e) Hearings For High-Impact Rules.\u2014Following notice of a proposed rule making, receipt of comments on the proposed rule, and any hearing held under subsection (d)(4), and before adoption of any high-impact rule, the agency shall hold a hearing in accordance with sections 556 and 557, unless such hearing is waived by all participants in the rule making other than the agency. The agency shall provide a reasonable opportunity for cross-examination at such hearing. The hearing shall be limited to the following issues of fact, except that participants at the hearing other than the agency may waive determination of any such issue:\n\u201c(1) Whether the agency\u2019s asserted factual predicate for the rule is supported by the evidence.\n\u201c(2) Whether there is an alternative to the proposed rule that would achieve the relevant statutory objectives at a lower cost (including all costs to be considered under subsection (b)(6)) than the proposed rule.\n\u201c(3) If there is more than one alternative to the proposed rule that would achieve the relevant statutory objectives at a lower cost than the proposed rule, which alternative would achieve the relevant statutory objectives at the lowest cost.\n\u201c(4) Whether, if the agency proposes to adopt a rule that is more costly than the least costly alternative that would achieve the relevant statutory objectives (including all costs to be considered under subsection (b)(6)), the additional benefits of the more costly rule exceed the additional costs of the more costly rule.\n\u201c(5) Whether the evidence and other information upon which the agency bases the proposed rule meets the requirements of the Information Quality Act.\n\u201c(6) Upon petition by an interested person who has participated in the rule making, other issues relevant to the rule making, unless the agency determines that consideration of the issues at the hearing would not advance consideration of the rule or would, in light of the nature of the need for agency action, unreasonably delay completion of the rule making. An agency shall grant or deny a petition under this paragraph within 30 days of its receipt of the petition.\nNo later than 45 days before any hearing held under this subsection or sections 556 and 557, the agency shall publish in the Federal Register a notice specifying the proposed rule to be considered at such hearing, the issues to be considered at the hearing, and the time and place for such hearing, except that such notice may be issued not later than 15 days before a hearing held under subsection (d)(4)(B).\n\u201c(f) Final Rules.\u2014 (1) The agency shall adopt a rule only following consultation with the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs to facilitate compliance with applicable rule making requirements.\n\u201c(2) The agency shall adopt a rule only on the basis of the best reasonably obtainable scientific, technical, economic, and other evidence and information concerning the need for, consequences of, and alternatives to the rule.\n\u201c(3) (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the agency shall adopt the least costly rule considered during the rule making (including all costs to be considered under subsection (b)(6)) that meets relevant statutory objectives.\n\u201c(B) The agency may adopt a rule that is more costly than the least costly alternative that would achieve the relevant statutory objectives only if the additional benefits of the more costly rule justify its additional costs and only if the agency explains its reason for doing so based on interests of public health, safety or welfare that are clearly within the scope of the statutory provision authorizing the rule.\n\u201c(4) When it adopts a final rule, the agency shall publish a notice of final rule making. The notice shall include\u2014\n\u201c(A) a concise, general statement of the rule\u2019s basis and purpose;\n\u201c(B) the agency\u2019s reasoned final determination of need for a rule to address the problem the agency seeks to address with the rule, including a statement of whether a rule is required by statute and a summary of any final risk assessment or regulatory impact analysis prepared by the agency;\n\u201c(C) the agency\u2019s reasoned final determination that the benefits of the rule meet the relevant statutory objectives and justify the rule\u2019s costs (including all costs to be considered under subsection (b)(6));\n\u201c(D) the agency\u2019s reasoned final determination not to adopt any of the alternatives to the proposed rule considered by the agency during the rule making, including\u2014\n\u201c(i) the agency\u2019s reasoned final determination that no alternative considered achieved the relevant statutory objectives with lower costs (including all costs to be considered under subsection (b)(6)) than the rule;

or\n\u201c(ii) that existing rules have created or contributed to the problem the agency seeks to address with the rule, and, if so\u2014\n\u201c(I) why amendment or rescission of such existing rules is not alone sufficient to respond to the problem; and\n\u201c(II) whether and how the agency intends to amend or rescind the existing rule separate from adoption of the rule;\n\u201c(F) the agency\u2019s reasoned final determination that the evidence and other information upon which the agency bases the rule complies with the Information Quality Act;\n\u201c(G) the agency\u2019s reasoned final determination that the rule meets the objectives that the agency identified in subsection (d)(1)(E)(iii) or that other objectives are more appropriate in light of the full administrative record and the rule meets those objectives;\n\u201c(H) the agency\u2019s reasoned final determination that it did not deviate from the metrics the agency included in subsection (d)(1)(E)(iii) or that other metrics are more appropriate in light of the full administrative record and the agency did not deviate from those metrics;\n\u201c(I) (i) for any major rule, high-impact rule, or negative-impact on jobs and wages rule, the agency\u2019s plan for review of the rule no less than every ten years to determine whether, based upon evidence, there remains a need for the rule, whether the rule is in fact achieving statutory objectives, whether the rule\u2019s benefits continue to justify its costs, and whether the rule can be modified or rescinded to reduce costs while continuing to achieve statutory objectives;\n\u201c(ii) review of a rule under a plan required by clause (i) of this subparagraph shall take into account the factors and criteria set forth in subsections (b) through (f) of section 553 of this title; and\n\u201c(iii) in the case of a major rule, a report on the benefits and costs of the final rule on entities whose conduct is regulated by the rule in the Federal Register, to be revised every 5 years thereafter while the rule remains in effect, and including, at a minimum\u2014\n\u201c(I) an assessment of the impacts, including any costs, of the major rule on regulated entities;\n\u201c(II) a determination about how the actual benefits and costs of the major rule have varied from those anticipated at the time the major rule was issued;\n\u201c(III) an assessment of the effectiveness and benefits of the major rule in producing the regulatory objectives of the major rule; and\n\u201c(IV) a review by the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget when required under executive order; and\n\u201c(J) for any negative-impact on jobs and wages rule, a statement that the head of the agency that made the rule approved the rule knowing about the findings and determination of the agency or the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs that qualified the rule as a negative impact on jobs and wages rule.\nAll information considered by the agency in connection with its adoption of the rule, and, at the discretion of the President or the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, information provided by that Office in consultations with the agency, shall be placed in the docket for the rule and made accessible to the public for the public\u2019s use no later than when the rule is adopted.\n\u201c(g) Exceptions From Notice And Hearing Requirements.\u2014 (1) Except when notice or hearing is required by statute, the following do not apply to interpretive rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice:\n\u201c(A) Subsections (c) through (e).\n\u201c(B) Paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (f).\n\u201c(C) Subparagraphs (B) through (H) of subsection (f)(4).\n\u201c(2) (A) When the agency for good cause, based upon evidence, finds (and incorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons therefor in the rules issued) that compliance with subsection (c), (d), or (e) or requirements to render final determinations under subsection (f) of this section before the issuance of an interim rule is impracticable or contrary to the public interest, including interests of national security, such subsections or requirements to render final determinations shall not apply to the agency\u2019s adoption of an interim rule.\n\u201c(B) If, following compliance with subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the agency adopts an interim rule, it shall commence proceedings that comply fully with subsections (d) through (f) of this section immediately upon publication of the interim rule, shall treat the publication of the interim rule as publication of a notice of proposed rule making and shall not be required to issue supplemental notice other than to complete full compliance with subsection (d). No less than 270 days from publication of the interim rule (or 18 months in the case of a major rule or high-impact rule), the agency shall complete rule making under subsections (d) through (f) of this subsection and take final action to adopt a final rule or rescind the interim rule. If the agency fails to take timely final action, the interim rule will cease to have the effect of law.\n\u201c(C) Other than in cases involving interests of national security, upon the agency\u2019s publication of an interim rule without compliance with subsection (c), (d), or (e) or requirements to render final determinations under subsection (f) of this section, an interested party may seek immediate judicial review under chapter 7 of this title of the agency\u2019s determination to adopt such interim rule. The record on such review shall include all documents and information considered by the agency and any additional information presented by a party that the court determines necessary to consider to assure justice.\n\u201c(3) When the agency for good cause finds (and incorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons therefor in the rules issued) that notice and public procedure thereon are unnecessary, including because agency rule making is undertaken only to correct a de minimis technical or clerical error in a previously issued rule or for other noncontroversial purposes, the agency may publish a rule without compliance with subsection (c), (d), (e), or (f)(1)\u2013(3) and (f)(4)(B)\u2013(F). If the agency receives significant adverse comment within 60 days after publication of the rule, it shall treat the notice of the rule as a notice of proposed rule making and complete rule making in compliance with subsections (d) and (f).\n\u201c(h) Additional Requirements For Hearings.\u2014When a hearing is required under subsection (e) or is otherwise required by statute or at the agency\u2019s discretion before adoption of a rule, the agency shall comply with the requirements of sections 556 and 557 in addition to the requirements of subsection (f) in adopting the rule and in providing notice of the rule\u2019s adoption.\n\u201c(i) Date Of Publication Of Rule.\u2014The required publication or service of a substantive final or interim rule shall be made not less than 30 days before the effective date of the rule, except\u2014\n\u201c(1) a substantive rule which grants or recognizes an exemption or relieves a restriction;\n\u201c(2) interpretive rules and statements of policy; or\n\u201c(3) as otherwise provided by the agency for good cause found and published with the rule.\n\u201c(j) Right To Petition.\u2014Each agency shall give an interested person the right to petition for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule.\n\u201c(k) Rule Making Guidelines.\u2014 (1) (A) The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs shall establish guidelines for the assessment, including quantitative and qualitative assessment, of the costs and benefits of proposed and final rules and other economic issues or issues related to risk that are relevant to rule making under this title. The rigor of cost-benefit analysis required by such guidelines shall be commensurate, in the Administrator\u2019s determination, with the economic impact of the rule.\n\u201c(B) To ensure that agencies use the best available techniques to quantify and evaluate anticipated present and future benefits, costs, other economic issues, and risks as accurately as possible, the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs shall regularly update guidelines established under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection.\n\u201c(2) The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs shall also issue guidelines to promote coordination, simplification and harmonization of agency rules during the rule making process and otherwise. Such guidelines shall assure that each agency avoids regulations that are inconsistent or incompatible with, or duplicative of, its other regulations and those of other Federal agencies and drafts its regulations to be simple and easy to understand, with the goal of minimizing the potential for uncertainty and litigation arising from such uncertainty.\n\u201c(3) To ensure consistency in Federal rule making, the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs shall\u2014\n\u201c(A) issue guidelines and otherwise take action to ensure that rule makings conducted in whole or in part under procedures specified in provisions of law other than those of subchapter II of this title conform to the fullest extent allowed by law with the procedures set forth in section 553 of this title; and\n\u201c(B) issue guidelines for the conduct of hearings under subsections 553(d)(4) and 553(e) of this section, including to assure a reasonable opportunity for cross-examination. Each agency shall adopt regulations for the conduct of hearings consistent with the guidelines issued under this subparagraph.\n\u201c(4) The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs shall issue guidelines pursuant to the Information Quality Act to apply in rule making proceedings under sections 553, 556, and 557 of this title. In all cases, such guidelines, and the Administrator\u2019s specific determinations regarding agency compliance with such guidelines, shall be entitled to judicial deference.\n\u201c(l) Inclusion In The Record Of Certain Documents And Information.\u2014The agency shall include in the record for a rule making, and shall make available by electronic means and otherwise, all documents and information prepared or considered by the agency during the proceeding, including, at the discretion of the President or the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, documents and information communicated by that Office during consultation with the Agency.\n\u201c(m) Monetary Policy Exemption.\u2014Nothing in subsection (b)(6), subparagraphs (F) and (G) of subsection (d)(1), subsection (e), subsection (f)(3), and subparagraphs (C) and (D) of subsection (f)(5) shall apply to rule makings that concern monetary policy proposed or implemented by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\u201c(n) Regulation-specific Frameworks.\u2014\n\u201c(1) REPORT TO CONGRESS.\u2014The agency shall provide a report to Congress not later than 90 days after the agency makes any determination under subsection (f)(4)(I)(iii)(II) that the cost to regulated entities has exceeded the anticipated cost at the time the final rule was issued. The agency, at a minimum, shall assess in the report\u2014\n\u201c(A) whether the major rule is accomplishing its regulatory objective; and\n\u201c(B) whether the major rule has been rendered unnecessary, taking into consideration\u2014\n\u201c(i) changes in the subject area affected by the major rule;\n\u201c(ii) whether the major rule overlaps, duplicates, or conflicts with other rules or, to the extent feasible, State and local government regulations; and\n\u201c(iii) other alternatives to the major rule or modification of the major rule that might achieve better results while imposing a smaller burden on society or at a lower cost, taking into consideration any cost already incurred.\n\u201c(2) REOPENING OF PUBLIC DOCKET.\u2014Upon delivery of the report required in paragraph (1) the agency shall\u2014\n\u201c(A) reopen the public docket for 60 days to receive additional comments; and\n\u201c(B) consider modifications or alternatives that reduce costs and increase benefits to regulated entities or individuals.\n\u201c(3) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\u2014Nothing in this subsection may be construed to affect any other provision of law that requires an agency to conduct retrospective reviews of rules issued by the agency.\u201d.\nSEC. 104.

When an agency decision rests on official notice of a material fact not appearing in the evidence in the record, a party is entitled, on timely request, to an opportunity to show the contrary.\n\u201c(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, in a proceeding held under this section pursuant to section 553(d)(4) or 553(e), the record for decision shall also include any information that is part of the record of proceedings under section 553.\n\u201c(f) When an agency conducts rule making under this section and section 557 directly after concluding proceedings upon an advance notice of proposed rule making under section 553(c), the matters to be considered and determinations to be made shall include, among other relevant matters and determinations, the matters and determinations described in subsections (b) and (f) of section 553.\n\u201c(g) Upon receipt of a petition for a hearing under this section, the agency shall grant the petition in the case of any major rule, unless the agency reasonably determines that a hearing would not advance consideration of the rule or would, in light of the need for agency action, unreasonably delay completion of the rule making. The agency shall publish its decision to grant or deny the petition when it renders the decision, including an explanation of the grounds for decision. The information contained in the petition shall in all cases be included in the administrative record.
